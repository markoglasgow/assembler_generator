- labels, directives?


- optional whitespaces?
- doesn't handle optional whitespace after commas ',' correctly
- support tabs \t and whitespaces

- need to make pointer expressions more complex
- handle case sensitive stuff?
- data statements
- string literals? 

- implement hello world program in x86 and ARM. Spec out these arches until you have enough to write the program

- emit MachO or ELF files of assembled programs. Will be tied to work on directives.

- detect recursive definitions in the grammar?
- make all bitfield values used BitArray instead of strings?

====================

[x] Install BitString and emit actual bitstream
[x] Use Capstone to disassemble bitstream, test it against expected assembly

[x] constraints on integer immediates. Parsing integer immediates.
[x] Plugin system for parsing integer immediates, and emitting their bitcode.

[x] build diagnostic error message as you parse, show the one with the longest parse depth in case of parse error
