- Install BitString and emit actual bitstream
- Use Capstone to disassemble bitstream, test it against expected assembly
- Use captstone in printing debug stream to disassemble it instruction by instruction

- optional whitespaces?
- doesn't handle optional whitespace after commas ',' correctly
- support tabs \t and whitespaces
- constraints on integer immediates. Parsing integer immediates.
- Plugin system for parsing integer immediates, and emitting their bitcode.

- build diagnostic error message as you parse, show the one with the longest 'pos' in case of parse error

- need to make pointer expressions more complex
- labels, directives?
- handle case sensitive stuff?
- string literals? 

- detect recursive definitions in the grammar?
