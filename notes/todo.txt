- implement hello world program in ARM. 
- On Xubuntu: Install QEMU and get ARM hello world program running on it.
- Make documentation
- Make a tutorial walkthrough

- Comment the code

------
- optional whitespaces?
- doesn't handle optional whitespace after commas ',' correctly

- need to make pointer expressions more complex
- handle case sensitive stuff?

- implement directives?
- string literals? 

- detect recursive definitions in the grammar?
- make all bitfield values use BitArray instead of strings?

====================

[x] Install BitString and emit actual bitstream
[x] Use Capstone to disassemble bitstream, test it against expected assembly

[x] constraints on integer immediates. Parsing integer immediates.
[x] Plugin system for parsing integer immediates, and emitting their bitcode.

[x] build diagnostic error message as you parse, show the one with the longest parse depth in case of parse error

[x] Implemented absolute and relative labels, and included in the default builtins immediate and relative x86 labels

[x] Data statements PoC

[x] support tabs \t as whitespaces
[x] make bytes print properly in debug statement
